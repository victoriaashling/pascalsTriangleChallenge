# pascalsTriangleChallenge

This is a small node program that will accept as an argument a number of rows and will then print out that number of rows of Pascal's Triangle.

This program can be run in node -- the first argument passed in after the file name will be parsed as the number of rows of Pascal's Triangle you'd like it to print out in the console.
